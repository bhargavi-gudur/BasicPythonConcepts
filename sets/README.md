# Python Sets Sample Code

## Overview

This project provides an example of how to work with sets in Python. Sets are a collection data type that is unordered and unindexed. They are commonly used to store multiple items in a single variable, where each item must be unique.

## Key Concepts

### Properties of Sets

1. **Unordered**: Sets do not maintain any order for the elements.
2. **No Duplicates**: Sets automatically remove duplicate elements.
3. **No Indexing or Slicing**: Sets do not support indexing or slicing.

### Basic Operations

- **Defining Sets**: Sets can be defined using curly braces `{}`.
- **Adding Elements**: Elements can be added to a set using the `add()` method.
- **Removing Elements**: Elements can be removed using the `remove()` method.
- **Popping Elements**: The `pop()` method removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set.
- **Adding Tuples**: Tuples can be added to a set, as they are immutable.

### Example Operations

- **Adding an Element**:
  ```python
  set1.add(78)
