# Python For Loop Example

Welcome to this repository where we explore some basic Python concepts, starting with the **for loop** and how to use it effectively. This particular example will demonstrate how a **`for loop`** can iterate over a sequence of numbers and print a custom message in each iteration.

## Purpose of This Example

In this example, we will use a **for loop** to print the message **"hello world, learn python"** along with the current iteration index. The idea is to show how a simple loop can be used to repeat tasks in Python.

## Code Walkthrough

Here's the code that demonstrates this functionality:

```python
# Define the number of iterations (loop count)
loop = 6

# Using a for loop to iterate over a range of numbers
for i in range(loop):
    print('hello world , learn python', i)
