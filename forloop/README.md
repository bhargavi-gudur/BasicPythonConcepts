# Sample Python Code for `for` Loop

## Overview

This sample project demonstrates the usage of `for` loops in Python to iterate over various data structures such as ranges, lists, and nested loops. The `for` loop is a fundamental control flow statement in Python that allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times efficiently.

## Key Concepts

### Iterating Over a Range

Using the `range()` function, you can generate a sequence of numbers. The `for` loop iterates over these numbers, executing the block of code for each number. This is useful for repetitive tasks where the number of iterations is known in advance.

### Iterating Over a List

A `for` loop can be used to iterate over the elements of a list. By using the `range()` function in combination with the `len()` function, the loop can access each element of the list via its index. This approach allows you to perform operations on each element of the list, regardless of its type or content.

### Nested `for` Loop

A nested `for` loop is a loop inside another loop. The outer loop runs first, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs completely. This is useful for tasks that require multiple levels of iteration, such as working with multi-dimensional arrays or generating combinations of values. The concept demonstrates how to perform complex iterations by nesting one loop inside another.

## Summary

- **`for` Loop with `range()`**: Generates a sequence of numbers to iterate over.
- **`for` Loop with Lists**: Iterates over list elements or list indices.
- **Nested `for` Loop**: Performs iterations within iterations for more complex tasks.

These examples provide a basic understanding of how to use `for` loops in Python to iterate over different data structures. Feel free to modify and expand upon these examples to explore more advanced usages and applications of `for` loops.
